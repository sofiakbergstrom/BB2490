## Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, by Lukas KÃ¤ll

Electro spry ionization, nobel prize 2002 (most popular these days)

Tandem mass spectrometry used to actively select a certain of the components, basically
to break and analyse individual subcomponents.

We need proteomics because:

1. If you know transcription level of genes, that doesn't mean that you know the expression
level of the proteins.
2. Protein may have different functions: There are many things going on on protein
level that can't be seen on gene expression level
3. Huges differences in expression of different proteins
4. Even worst with concentration in blood plasma
