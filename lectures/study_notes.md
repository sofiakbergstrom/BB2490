#### Genome assembly

- haploid/diploid/polyploid?
- BAC = Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
- paired end sequencing == mate pair sequencing
- contig == large region of the genome
- scaffold == large contigs

#### Short read sequencing

- For the quiz: How to map billions of reads onto a Genome
- SNV (Single Nucleotide Variants) are mutations with frequency > 1%, basically want to link mutations to conditions and disease.

#### RNA-seq and Chip-seq

- exons are part of the gene that actually encode as proteins.
- cDNA generation: Reverse transcription
- Reference transcriptome is the total set of RNAs of an organism
- de-novo asswmbly for RMA sequencing is much harder than for DNA sequencing, because the number of transcripts is much larger than the number of chromosomes
