# 2015-02-19 Lecture about the projects

Our project will finally be the miRNA QC project.

Project members: Sofia Bergstr√∂m and Yim Wing Chow (and me...) yimwingchow@gmail.com, sobergst@gmail.com

The aim is that we have the data, we are going to work the data and get some results,
not necessarily finish a pipeline. The poing is to get somewhere.
