# Project Diary

## 2015-02-25
Read two articles:
* Next Generation sequencing of miRNAs – Strategies, Resources and Methods
* Transcriptome and genome sequencing uncovers functional variation in humans

Our meeting was canceled since Guillermo was ill. 

## 2015-02-24
Read two articles: 
* Reproducibility of high-throughput mRNA and small RNA sequencing across laboratories 
  which investigated the sources to technical and interlaboratory differences in order to get a better understanding of them. 
* Functional shifts in insect microRNA evolution

I read the things it have written and learnt about miRNA in earlier courses and quickly read the four articles that we should read until wednesday.
