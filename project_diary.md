Seminarium 1 with short presentations. 
We decided to meet next Wednesday at 17.00 and Thursday, the same time. 

We decided to read four articles:
  Next Generation Sequencing of miRNAs â€“ Strategies, Resources and Methods
  Functional shifts in insect microRNA evolution
  Reproducibility of high-throughput mRNA and small RNA sequencing across laboratories.
  Transcriptome and genome sequencing uncovers functional variation in humans.
